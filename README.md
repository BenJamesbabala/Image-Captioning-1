# Image-Captioning

Using Flickr8k dataset since the size is 1GB. MS-COCO is 14GB!

Used Keras with Tensorflow backend for the code. For extracting features from the image, I am using VGG-16 with the last two layers(Dense layer with 1000 hidden neurons and the Dropout layer) removed. 

InceptionV3 outperforms Resnet-50 and Vgg-16.

Please feel free to contribute.
